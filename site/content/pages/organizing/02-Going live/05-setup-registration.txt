title: Setting up Registration
---
Once pricing has been decided you're ready to setup registration. We've had good experiences with <http://www.eventbrite.com> integrated with <http://paypal.com> payments. 
The paypal account for payment needs to be linked directly to the company that does the invoicing.

We as the devopsdays organization will create the event for you and give you administrative access. This allows us to track people from the website and do email communication in the future.

Specifically on eventbrite we do:

- ask for the company name and job title (useful to attract other people to the event)
- ask for T-shirt sizes
- ask if they require an invoice, if yes ask more details like VAT number if needed
- ask if there are interested in an evening event meetup

The email or direct-contact information should never be visible on the website or given out to vendors. We value privacy and anti-spam at lot!
