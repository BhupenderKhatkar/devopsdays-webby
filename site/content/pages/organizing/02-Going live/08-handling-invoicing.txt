title: Handling Invoicing
---
Part of organizing the event is the handling of the money. And handling money means official invoicing.
This will be needed for:

- invoicing sponsorship
- send official invoices to people that register
- paying suppliers like catering, T-shirts etc..

Trust us, you don't want to handle this dull things, you'd rather focus on the content and the other stuff of the event.

The way we handle this usually is to find a locally company that is willing to handle these logistics.
Depending on the size of the event, you might want to give a Silver or Gold sponsorship in return.

If a local company is not an option, we've worked with a few companies in the past that are willing to help you for a small fee in return.
