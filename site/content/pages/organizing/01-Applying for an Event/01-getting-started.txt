Congratulations! The fact that you have reached this page means you at least have interest in spreading the 'devops' love to world.
Back in 2009 when we organized the first event, we were probably as excited as you are now. But we were also bit 'scared' and full of questions:
How does this work? How do we get sponsors? What is the first thing we have to do?

We are now around 50 events later and as many gray hairs have appeared on our heads :). Even though every event is a bit unique in it's own way, we've come to a more of less standard approach for organizing these events.
With this document we want to support you and make you feel at ease of organizing one yourself. Don't worry we'll be there along the way!

We recommend you attend at least one DevOpsDays event first and get in touch with one of the [core organizers](mailto:info@devopsdays.org)
