title: The perfect program
---
After a few experiments we have settled on a __two day__ program with the following structure:

1. talks in the morning: this follow the more traditional format of a speaker, panel in a plenary session.
  - There is usually an introductory talk 15m at the beginning of the conference (like state of the union)
  - We found that regular talks of about 30minutes have the right balance for content.
  - Panels usually take 40-60 minutes.
2. followed by a set of ignite talks: 5 minute talks with 20 slides that auto-advance [More detail on Ignite format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/ignite-talks-format)
3. openspaces in the afternoon: a self organizing part where everybody gets to propose a session [More detail on OpenSpace Format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format)

During the openspace sessions we usually reserve a slot for 'openspace demo': a session where people can show off their tools, product (both commercial and non-commercial)

You can usually draw on different sources to get speakers:
- the call for proposals
- but you might want to contact speakers directly

A few words of advice:
- No sponsor should be able to buy their way into the program. The schedule should be group decided
- Usually you will receive more tools talks vs cultural talks. We believe it's important to keep the balance right
- Tool talks should be at the conceptual level not at the individual day-to-day level
- We prefer new speakers to come on board
- We prefer new content that was not presented yet (or was already recorded)
- Avoid inviting external rock-stars only, we need to make sure that local content/ideas get picked up and spread to the community
