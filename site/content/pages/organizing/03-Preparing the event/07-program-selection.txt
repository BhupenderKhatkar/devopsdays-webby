title: The perfect program
---
After a few experiments we have settled on a __two day__ program with the following structure:

1. talks in the morning: this follow the more traditional format of a speaker, panel in a plenary session.
  - There is usually an introductory talk 15m at the beginning of the conference (like state of the union)
  - We found that regular talks of about 30minutes have the right balance for content.
  - Panels usually take 40-60 minutes.
2. followed by a set of ignite talks: 5 minute talks with 20 slides that auto-advance [More detail on Ignite format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/ignite-talks-format)
3. openspaces in the afternoon: a self organizing part where everybody gets to propose a session [More detail on OpenSpace Format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format)

During the openspace sessions we usually reserve a slot for 'openspace demo': a session where people can show off their tools, product (both commercial and non-commercial)
