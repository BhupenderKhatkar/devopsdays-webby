Running Ignites can be challenge: people tend to submit them last minute, or they didn't understand the format to well.
Here are few tips on making this proces more smoothly:

- Ask the Ignite presenters to send the slides upfront
  - An option is to use a Dropbox shared directory
- Be prepared to run around with USB stick to get the 'on the spot' deciders.

- PDF is the easiest format to collect all presentations
- You can run either :
    - `impress -a 15` <http://impressive.sourceforge.net/>
    - adobe acrobat reader in autoadavance mode <http://malektips.com/adobe_reader_7_0019.html>
- Don't let them run on their own laptops
- Use a dedicated laptop (avoid any popups etc...)

- Mention again on the day itself:
  - "Just so you know, your slides will auto advance every 15 seconds, you can't advance them yourself"

- Have Ignite presenters queue next to the stage and either:
  - start the slidedeck for them.
  - or even build all slides in Slidedeck and build in a bio slide as a interludium and have that autoadvance as well
