title: "Knights of the Provisioning Round Table - Bare Metal Provisioning"
---

**Abstract:**

There has been a huge amount of interest and development around
virtualization, IaaS platforms, and "cloud computing" in general.
However, many of us still need to manage bare metal because we have
latency sensitive applications, or simply need to squeeze every last
cycle out of our hardware. Let's take a quick look at this neglected
class of tooling to see what the current state of the art is.

** Suggested panelists: **
Judd Maltin, Dell, Crowbar
Eric Shamow, Puppet, Razor
Sam Kottler, Foreman
Joyent / SmartOS?
Ubuntu/ Maas?
Anyone know a Cobbler?
??, ??, Something Else?
