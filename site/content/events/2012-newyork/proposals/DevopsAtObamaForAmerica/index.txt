title: "DevOps At Obama for America & The Democratic National Committee"
---

**Abstract:**

 Presidential Campaign is a billion dollar, over 6000 person organization that exists for roughly two years, and then disappears.

 How do you setup a systems infrastructure for such an organization?  How do you avoid organizational silos? Why even do DevOps? 
 What was the culture like and how did it meld with the traditional culture of political campaigns and committees? 
 What are some lessons learned from the 2012 campaign -- what things worked and what didn't?

 Come learn about the answers to all of these questions, as well as our technology stack
 (AWS/Puppet/Ubuntu/CentOS/Github/Juniper/Nagios/OpsView & much more),
 why we chose it, how we set it up, and how we made it work.

**Speaker:**
Leo Zhadanovsky - Director of Systems Engineering @ The Democratic National Committee
John Schneider - DevOps Engineer @ Obama for America - Mozilla Foundation
