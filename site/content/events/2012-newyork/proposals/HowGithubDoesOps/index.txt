title: "How Github does Ops"
---

**Abstract:**

GitHub is growing very rapidly and with a widely distributed team -- when
this was written there were 124 GitHubbers spread across 54 cities. To say
that we invest a lot of time and energy in supporting remote work would be
a massive understatement.

We use a mixture of GitHub pull requests and issues, Campfire chat, shared
graphs, and an enormous pile of Hubot scripts to make things go and keep
everyone in sync. Join me for a whirlwind tour through a day in the life of
GitHub ops.

**Speaker:**
Mark Imbriaco
