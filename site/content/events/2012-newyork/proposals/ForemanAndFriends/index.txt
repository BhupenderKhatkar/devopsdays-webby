**Abstract:**

The Foreman is a powerful open source reporting, provisioning, and lifecycle management tool built atop Puppet. In this talk I will demo different pieces of functionality, including host search, statistics, EC2/OpenStack/libvirt/oVirt provisioning, DHCP and tftp management, as well as organizational features for logically grouping hosts. In addition to delving into a live demo, I'll cover the community, ecosystem, and Puppet basics for those without configuration management experience.
