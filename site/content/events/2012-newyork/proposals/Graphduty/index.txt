title: "Graphduty: monitoring via graphite"
---

**Abstract:**
At knewton, we've managed to get pervasive system statistics into
graphite across all of our deployments.  In-house software, system
stats, and servers (cassandra, rabbitmq, etc.) all report into
graphite.

We've leveraged this by writing a simple tool, called graphduty, which
will read configured sets of stats from graphite, and edge-trigger on
events and notify pagerduty so that they can be addressed without
having to create monster dashboards.
