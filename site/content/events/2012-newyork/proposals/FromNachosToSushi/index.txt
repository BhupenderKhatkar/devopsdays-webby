title: "From Nachos to Sushi: A monitoring Love Story"
---

**Abstract:**

Paperless Post recently ditched Nagios and Munin in favor of
Sensu, the open source monitoring and metrics router. Sensu is a cinch
to deploy using Chef and a pleasure to interact with using the Sensu
API.  Weâ€™ll preview Sushi, our home-grown Sensu dashboard for viewing
environment health, and show how we use Sensu to collect and graph
system metrics in Graphiti, our open-source Graphite front end.

**Speaker:**
Bethany Benzur
