---

**Abstract:**

Opscode recently announced Test Kitchen which provisions an isolated test environment using Vagrant to run project tests on different platforms.  Test Kitchen utilizes a number of different technologies including Vagrant, Foodcritic, Chef (of course), and mini-test-chef-handler.  In this talk, you'll learn more about Test Kitchen and see how to start using it with your own infrastructure code.
