title: "Speeding Up Releases"
---

**Abstract:**
The cool DevOps thing to do is to do continuous deployment.  However, many shops are in a situation where they already have long release cycles, large amounts of legacy code and inelastic hardware. Has DevOps abandoned you?  No - hear how Bazaarvoice moved from a 10-week "big bang" release cycle to biweekly and then weekly releases without "rewriting the world."  cf. http://theagileadmin.com/2012/10/14/speeding-up-releases/
