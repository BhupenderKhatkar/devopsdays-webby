title: "Goodbye Hello World: How a Fully Provisioned Demo Application Helps All Our Rebels"
---

**Abstract:**
We built two full-blown Q&A applications, one in PHP/Yii and another one in JEE/Spring. However, what started out as a real-world test to exercise all the features of our product, turned into a lot more. We created a virtualized multi-machine environment that is automatically provisioned. This allowed everyone in the company to use this application as a reference point without having to go through any of the tedious configuration and setup tasks. Anyone, anywhere, can now quickly start up a predictable environment that behaves exactly the same for everyone else.

We noticed that many different people at ZeroTurnaround are now relying on it:

*  developers use it to enhance the product and fix bugs
*  QA use it to validate product features
*  content writers use it to reference working examples
*  sales uses it to demonstrate our products in a realistic setting
*  evangelists use it at demo booths
*  our CEO uses it for his webinars
*  and finally ... our customers use it as an inspiration for their own setups

In this talk we'll go through the different aspects of setting up such an automatically provisioned virtualized environment. We'll introduce Vagrant, Chef and how they work together. We'll share some of the mistakes we made, so that you can avoid them and you'll also see some of the custom provisioning scripts that we wrote and how we structure them. Finally, we'll demonstrate how it all comes together and highlight some of the notable uses of this setup amongst the ZeroTurnaround Rebels.

Goodbye to the trivial Hello World. Hello to the massively useful DevOps World!
