title: "Weapons for Operational Kung-Fu: Wielding (and Welding) Ironfan"
---

**Abstract:**
Infochimps works in the deep end of DevOps: all of our ops code, and
all of our devs deploy. Nathaniel Eliot and Brandon Bell will walk you
through how the Ironfan cloud orchestration suite makes that possible.
You'll learn the basics of using Ironfan, and see powerful techniques
to attack your operational problems with. We'll close with some of the
advanced techniques we're still perfecting, and some of the basics of
customizing Ironfan to your needs.

**Speaker:**

Nathaniel Eliot, Brandon Bell
