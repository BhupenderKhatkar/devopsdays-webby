title: "Malware has changed the way we think about Information Security."
---

**Abstract:**
Malware has changed the way we think about Information Security.  It’s time to rethink the way we deal with newly engineered advanced malware.  Management and technical staff will leave with actionable information on how to lower incident related costs through better detection and response

Stuxnet, Duqu, Flamer and Red October went undetected for years.  We need a new approach to deal with advanced malware.  Anti-Virus companies admit 80% of malware is unique to 10 companies or less.  This talk will share advanced malware detection techniques from the folks in the trenches and what you can actually do to prepare for and detect it.  Management and technical staff will leave with actionable information on how to lower incident related costs through better detection and response and integration into DevOps environments.

The presentation will discuss recent statistics, incidents and costs around APT and recent advanced malware events.  Anti-Malware defenses are failing everyone and only detects 5%, or less of this newly engineered advanced malware.  2012 annual reports by Verizon, Trustwave, Mandiant and others show this problem is only getting worse.  This talk will address the ever increasing failures of anti-malware solutions and examples of security defense solution failures will also be discussed.  The audience will be polled on their opinions and experiences.    Finally, we will introduce a new way of thinking and methodology to prepare organizations for detection of the simplest to the most advanced malware.  We will also show how this method can save significant costs in future incident response events.  Integrating this methodology into a DevOps environment will also be covered as DevOps environments are already ready to implement this new method.  Actual malware will be used in this presentation to illustrate the point.
