title: "Beyond open source configuration management - Rapidly building any cloud at scale "
---

**Abstract:**
Open source tools for configuration management have been available for years. But a new breed of tools is expanding the realm of what is possible. These new tools are built for the speed and scale of any cloud and now provide remote execution, orchestration and deployment of heterogeneous clouds and computing platforms, real-time infrastructure data, workflow automation, and efficient, fast communications in addition to configuration management. Thomas Hatch, creator of the Salt open source project, will detail the availability and usage of various open source management tools like ZeroMQ, Cobbler, Nova, Rundeck, Salt and Jenkins, all built for the requirements of cloud at scale and help automate data center management. Configuration management is just the start of what is possible with open source software for infrastructure management. Attend this presentation to learn what the bleeding edge of open source holds for server automation.
