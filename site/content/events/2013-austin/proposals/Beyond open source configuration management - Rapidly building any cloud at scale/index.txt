**Abstract:**
A lot of CI Servers today offer a lot of functionality out of the box or through plugins, but as projects and companies grow, the code base outgrows the initial setup and scalability becomes a concern. Ideally, all projects would have a very thin build plan that interacts with a build system that exposes a set of "verbs" or actions that it can perform through a DSL. This way, the CI server is just a broker, pressing the right buttons, the real heavy work is on the build system and we don't really have to pay for a CI server. We can take it one step further if we package and release the build system as an artifact and bootstrap it as the first dependency of each project.
