title: "Deploying 10,000 nodes simultaneously "
---

**Abstract:**
Show the challenges of deploying many thousands of nodes in an extremely short amount of time. After having tried a number of solutions we have reduced our deploy time from hours to minutes using a combination of  virtualenv,  puppet and bittorrent.  Will cover previous solutions and direction of tooling as it evolves.
