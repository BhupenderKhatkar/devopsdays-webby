**Abstract:**
Do your developers have the root private keys for your entire architecture?
What happens when you need to re-key all of your instances?

This talk will outline not only a framework, but provide code snippets for automating the OpenSSH keying and re-keying of your Amazon EC2 instances using Chef and Chef Server.
