**Abstract:**
Making team values and work ethics explicit. Work ethics and values effect all aspects of a team's contribution whether they are made explicit or are merely an unintended consequence of team composition. This talk explores the nature of workplace ethics, techniques to help team's discover what they value (and what they don't) and how to make their ethics clear to themselves, their customers, and their sponsors.

I'll discuss topics relevant to Dev Ops culture: cross functional and self managed teams, team composition, team selection, ethics, business value, mastery, emotional intelligence, current brain science, and agile practices. I'll also talk about about philosophy (Buddhist and Western). I will definitely talk about what it means to be responsible, open, and clear about who we are at work.
