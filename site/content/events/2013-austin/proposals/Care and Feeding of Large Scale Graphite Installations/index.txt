title: "Care and Feeding of Large Scale Graphite Installations"
---

**Abstract:**
By making DevOps _visible_, you not only gain insights into your business, but also reduces need to log-in production machines, and provide valuable promotion for what you do.   And you can diagnose and solve arguments using _data_.  

At IPONWEB, we do this using graphite (https://github.com/graphite-project).  We have 30 large scale graphite installations with a mix of machine-level and business data, each doing 100k data points per minute.  These installations run both in the cloud and fixed-size infrastructure.

This talk cover some of tips and tricks we have learned:

Quickly:

  * Graphite Hello World
  * Graphite: What's up with the documentation?
  * Graphite Vs. RRD
  * Graphite Vs. Your Existing Monitoring System
  * Graphite Your Graphite (key metrics in graphite on how well it is running).
  * Graphite Versions and Linux Kernel best practices
  * Disk configuration best practices
  * Getting Data In:  Carbon Aggregator vs. StatsD (and friends)
  * Getting Data out (raw data, client side rendering vs. server-side rendering)
  * Graphite Monitoring: when is overloaded and dropping data
  * Stupid Graphite Tricks: "Events"
  * Stupid Graphite Tricks: Process Monitoring
  * Stupid Graphite Tricks: Making security visible

And no doubt a lot more!
