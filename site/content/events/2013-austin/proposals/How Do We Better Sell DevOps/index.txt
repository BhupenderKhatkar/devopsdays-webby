title: "How Do We Better Sell DevOps?"
---

**Abstract:**
In this talk, I will share my top lessons learned over my years studying high performing IT organizations on how to sell the value of DevOps, and help other stakeholders and executives have their own a-ha moments.  I will talk about specific stories about the circumstances that led to these a-ha moments, how they created DevOps champions in surprising places in organizations you'll recognize, and how they enabled implementing DevOps patterns that had awesome results.

This will be based on the presentation that I first did at DevOpsDays London: http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/how-can-we-better-sell-devops.  (The tweet stream is captured at the bottom of the page here: http://scribes.tweetscriber.com/realgenekim/114)
