title: "Who is the Enemy - Us or Motionlessness?"
---

**Abstract:**
Problems between teams begin when they are unaware of mutually critical information and unable to consider the perspectives and needs of other groups.
 
Bringing visibility to invisible work and considering the flow of work over efficiency of of work may help teams gain the perspective necessary to influence culture change.
 
We pretty much ignore invisible work. And that causes all kinds of problems – from unknown dependencies to excessive context switching to dark matter – it all costs money.
 
But it’s also a problem when we focus on the most visible form of waste – inefficient activity. Horrors if a worker appear idle! Is making activities more efficient really less important than eliminating inactivity? Is the problem inactive workers or motionless work?
 
This talk aims to answer those questions and address the following topics:
· The invisible cost of idle work and what can be done about it.
· Why 100% capacity utilization doesn’t work.
· Why Queues matter.
· Effects of WIP constraints.
