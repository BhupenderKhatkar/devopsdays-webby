title: "Its not me, its you - your dysfunctional relationship with script code"
---

**Abstract:**
Nearly every online company has moderate to significant amounts of shell scripts.  The code is critical in that bugs will effect the business in a significant way.  Despite this criticality, developing modular, tested and documented scripting is either rare or nonexistent. This presentation will offer a possible solution to this industry wide problem with a simple open source tool called Rerun which adds a modular formalism to Bash scripting.  A simple module will be created, implemented, and tested rapidly.  Your colleagues will be able to quickly find and enhance your automation code in a syntax that every DevOps practitioner knows.  No more excuses for bad bash.
