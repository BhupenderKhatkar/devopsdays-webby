title: "Stop templating, start configuring"
---

**Abstract:**
When you read through a configuration management manifest and all you see are a bunch of files being deployed. Can you actually tell how the system is configured?  How many copies of those templates do you have to manage if you support multiple OS's?

Wouldn't it be nice if you configuration files had an API?  Wouldn't it be even better if that was exposed in your configuration management?

Enter Augeas and Augeasproviders for Puppet.

Augeas providers an API thats accessible with native bindings in multiple languages, including c, python, ruby, and even ___.  

Augeasproviders is a handful of new types and Providers written directly in Ruby to extend Puppet.  Now instead of managing a template for sshd_config you can actually configure sshd_config parameters.

sshd_config { 'PermitRootLogin': value => 'no' }

There are already a handful of types and providers, but more are welcome!
