title: "Chef Resources and Providers"
---
**Abstract:**

I spoke a few weeks ago at Chefconf on this subject, and I've made further progress I'd love to share. Specifically, I want to share a presentation with some useful OOP techniques that can be applied to Chef Cookbook development. I would like to discuss how some changes to cookbook design can help with code reuse, flexibility, and testing. I've been working on a cookbook to manage logstash that features these decisions. My intention is that this talk will be a 'take 2' on my chefconf talk with more details and working code.

I plan on using it to demonstrate:

- Instances
- Duck Types
- Sending messages to resources instead of cloning them [CHEF-3694](https://gist.github.com/danielsdeleo/30a8719901eca6545488)
- Automatically generating resources and working with a common provider.
