title: "TestKitchen2 - a config mgmt neutral testing framework"
---
**Abstract:**

We've come a long way with infrastructure as code and getting closer to better test frameworks and facilities.

This talk will focus on how [test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen) can help in shorting the feedback cycle during development of cookbooks or manifest and how it plays nice with other existing tools like chef-spec, vagrant. And while it was originally tied with chef it is now becoming a standard across different config mgmtm tools.

Learn about unit as well as smoke testing infrastructure as code in a TDD cycle. Besides the technology we will look into the benefits of this faster feedback cycle and the current/future state of infrastructure as code testing.
