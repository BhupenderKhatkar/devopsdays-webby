title: "Continuously deploying Mingle on the cloud - a showcase"
---
**Abstract:**

When we started migrating our installed app to a SaaS model, we realized we'd have to follow CD practices that were better suited for the cloud.

In this session we will:

- Discuss some of the practices and principles we followed along the way.
- Showcase our deployment process and the AWS APIs and services used to automate our infrastructure.
- Discuss some of the operational practices we came to appreciate.
- Approaches to speeding up deployment and achieving zero downtime deployments.

While we deploy our application on AWS I will focus on principles and patterns that can be useful regardless of your IAAS provider.
