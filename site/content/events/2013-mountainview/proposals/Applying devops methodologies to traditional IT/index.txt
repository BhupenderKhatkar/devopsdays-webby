title: "Applying devops methodologies to traditional IT"
---

**Abstract:**

Applying devops methodologies to traditional IT: challenges, tools, success factors, road ahead.

Using DevOps methods to get a small infrastructure into a successful continuous release model has been done, applying the same methods within traditional IT is riddled with pitfalls, cultural and technological challenges.

These challenges becomes monumental with big data and large infrastructure sizes; letâ€™s consider our experience bringing the light of devops to an archiving cloud with 60 PETABYTES of stored data, 25000 servers, mixed OS environment and 99.999% uptime requirement.
