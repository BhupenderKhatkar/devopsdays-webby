**Abstract:**

Sascha Bates' opening keynote will dive into the questions of how to level up your DevOps practice. She'll discuss how to go from the zeal of a convert to the calm competence of an accomplished practitioner, touching on the introspection necessary to realize that DevOps is neither a tool to adjust everyone else to one's own standards nor a mechanism to correct the interactions of others.
