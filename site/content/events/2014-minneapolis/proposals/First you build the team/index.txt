**Abstract:**

At the core of every output is a team who must work together, trust each other, and overcome obstacles to build a thing. Since we rarely get to hand pick our teams, this talk will provide five (not-so-easy) tips to build an environment in which they thrive. 

**Speaker:**
Nivia Henry
