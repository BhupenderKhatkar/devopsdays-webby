**Abstract:**

When large organizations start on the devops journey, they sometimes fool themselves into thinking a small, specialized team is what they need to infect the rest with success. Unfortunately, most organizations that take this approach ultimately run into a scaling problem -- bottlenecks, ugh! This talk will discuss some of the common approaches organizations take when trying to change and how to avoid setting yourself up for failure in the long run.
