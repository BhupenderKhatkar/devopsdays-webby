**Abstract:**

As the world of digital analytics evolves, the relationship between IT, developers and analytics has merged--often resulting in clashing ideas, in-depth discussions of web structure and forced collaboration.                 
                                                                                
Within the brief ignite, I'll be applying the idea of how DevOp/IT web structure understandings and digital analytics 'Clash'--for the better. The ignite will highlight a few web measurement cases (examples) to provide support and relate-ability to the talk.
