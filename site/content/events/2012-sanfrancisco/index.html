After the two previous awesome devopsdays in the Mountain View area, we're pleased to announce that:

On **Thursday 28 and Friday 29 of June** just after after the [Oreilly - Velocity Conference](http://velocityconf.com),<br> we'll have another two-day devopsdays event.

We are currently scouting the area in and around San-Francisco to find the best venue. <br>Final location will be announced beginning of March 2012.

Interested in helping organizing, speaking, sponsoring or just giving your moral support?
