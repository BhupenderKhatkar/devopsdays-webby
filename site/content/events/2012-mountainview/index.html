- [WebPerfDays](http://webperfdays.org/) - the unconference that brings the webperformance community together
-->

<p>The event moved and will be located at the <a href="location">Silicon Valley Cloud Center</a>.</p>

<p>The event is being live-streamed by BMC <a href="https://communities.bmc.com/communities/community/bsm_initiatives/devops">here</a></p>
