**Abstract:**

Back in 2011 at Prezi we started off with a single SQL query that worked on a few megabytes of data and produced somewhat accurate numbers satisfying basic business needs. This used to be our BI platform. Today we run a data infrastructure with around 70 high-performance servers that crunch hundreds of gigabytes of data and feed hundreds of reports day by day.

Along this journey we used standard Unix and statistical software, later on-premise Hadoop clusters, NoSQL databases and third-party BI tools. Learning from our mistakes we rebuilt our data infrastructure and ETL systems many times.

We’ll share the successes and misses we encountered throughout this journey with a special focus on our current experiences with managed solutions such as Amazon’s Elastic MapReduce Hadoop solution and Redshift, Amazon’s hosted data warehouse solution.

__Zoltán Tóth__
Data Engineer

Prior to joining Prezi Zoltán worked as a developer/architect for pharmaceutical market research companies. Now, as Senior Data Engineer, he helps Prezi build and operate a world-class data infrastructure. In his free time he enjoys cooking and simplicity and is a wannabe triathlete.

__Julianna Göbölös-Szabó__
Data Engineer

As a mathematician by education, Julcsi worked for years in a research institute and analysed big networks. Now she is a data engineer at Prezi building a reliable and easy-to-use ETL system for both developers and non-tech colleagues. In her free time she enjoys eating delicious food and then burning calories with running, swimming or biking.
