**Abstract:**

Back in 2011 at Prezi we started off with a single SQL query that worked on a few megabytes of data and produced somewhat accurate numbers satisfying basic business needs. This used to be our BI platform. Today we run a data infrastructure with around 70 high-performance servers, which crunch hundreds of gigabytes of data and feed hundreds of reports day by day.

Along this journey we used standard Unix and statistical software, later on-premise Hadoop clusters, NoSQL databases and third-party BI tools. Learning from our mistakes we rebuilt our data infrastructure and ETL systems many times. Weâ€™ll share the successes and misses we encountered throughout this journey.
