### Rules
* Be specific! We aren't mind readers - a description of about 20 lines is about right.
* Detail is good, but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting.
* Nominations welcome. If you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction.
* Multiple proposals are welcome - just follow the other rules.

### What we're looking for

* We're very interested in new ideas and novel concepts - especially if this is your first time presenting on the topic.
* Talks which have a strong **human** element are particularly compelling. Take a look at the programme from the <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2014-belgium/program/">Belgium 2014</a> for some great examples.
* Sincerity and passion go a long way - if you're excited then we are too!

### Presentation formats
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
