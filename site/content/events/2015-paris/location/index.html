## Travel

### Air
Paris is a major European air hub.  All major world carriers and alliances operate (often multiple) daily flights.

There are two airports that service Paris:

* [Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG / LFPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport)
* [Paris Orly Airport (ORY / LFPO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly_Airport)

In general, CDG handles larger planes and longer distances, but there are exceptions. Both airports are
equally accessible from the city by public transport and private car or taxi.

### Rail
Paris is a major European rail hub and is well served by high-speed (TGV) rail links from across Europe.

### Public Transportation
Paris has mature public transportation infrastructure including a massive metro (subway) system, buses, and tramways. Tickets can be purchased from machines at any metro station using money or bank cards.
