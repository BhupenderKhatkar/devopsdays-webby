title: "Enterprise DevOps - Going Big and f*$^#&g up, a Cautionary Tale"
---

**Abstract:**

I'll talk through the steps we took to establishing cultural change via DevOps in a traditional brokerage firm and how we totally screwed it up.  I'll focus in particular on the process, systems, and technology culture of the organization.

1.The history of the company and why it was obvious it would fail. Culture, Rewards, Technology.

2. The technology composition, i.e What they focussed spending on, and how we funded the project and regulatory pressures they were under. 

3. How our vision was idealistic, and our team became arrogant. (us vs them). ie: Why creating a DevOps team failed.

4. The proliferation of tools that were used, the tools we introduced. The tools they actually ended up using. (I'll talk a little about Chef, and the sheer amount of code we wrote)

5. The workflow of failure - Confronting ITIL, COBIT, AGILE, the PMO & Introducing new nomenclature that screwed it up.

6. What worked and mostly what didn't work.

7. When success is declared despite the obvious failure.
