title: "Time Management for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

The one thing we all wish we had more of is time!  The O'Reilly "Time
Management for Sysadmins" is full of great examples in a pre-DevOps
world.  This presentation will re-envision the book as a tool for
DevOps implementing Gene Kim's "Three Ways of DevOps".

Note to the planning committee:

The book claims the three keys of good time management are:

Key 1:  Write it down, don't try to memorize it.
(Or "DevOps Second Way: Amplify feedback loops")

Key 2:  Go from being interrupt/reaction-driven to planned and systematic:
(this is really the goal of The Three Ways, is it not?)

Key 3; Automate, automate, automate.
(DevOps takes this to new extremes, especially for Infrastructure As Code)

In the talk I can either focus on explaining The Three Ways in terms
of how the improve time management, or I can explain time management
with devops examples instead of the usual enterprise examples that the
book uses.
