title: "We all scream for Metrics! Instrumentating everything via StatsD"
---

**Abstract:**

"Maybe we have too many metrics." ~ said nobody.                                
                                                                                
The biz team wants revenue numbers. Developers want call times on key           
methods. You want response times and error rates. We ALL want metrics, but      
instrumenting, viewing, and monitoring our key metrics typically involves       
many tools, lots of coordination, and worries about overhead.                   
                                                                                
StatsD, open-sourced by Etsy, gives us a way to simplify instrumentation,       
and I'll walk thru the Swiss Army knife of metrics in a production setup.       
I'll show real-world examples that illustrate how dev and devops teams can      
leverage StatsD to instrument just about everything: even the temperature       
of your meat as it sizzles on the grill during a weekend BBQ. Besides code      
examples, I'll answer the key questions: does it scale? what's an               
end-to-end StatsD stack look like? How much work is it to manage? What's        
the language support? Will my hand hurt from awkward tech high-fives as         
metrics appear with sudden ease?                                                
                                                                                
In a nutshell, you'll walk away with the key shortcuts to get started on a      
tool you've been excited to try but haven't had time to explore.
