title: Red Dots Are Bad - Visual Alerting
---

 
###<i>AKA: If you want their attention flash the Devs.</i>

**Abstract:**

Discuss the advantages of visual alerting and monitoring to easily notify Ops and Devs of issues in the Deployment and Hosting System.

We found that by adding visual alerting on NOC style monitors we were able to more effectively react to issues when they occurred.

Basic web/gui/flash interfaces were much more useful than longer term trending graphs and the normal type of things you might find on NOC screens.
