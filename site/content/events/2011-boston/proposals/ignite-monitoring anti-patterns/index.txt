title: monitoring anti-patterns
---

**Abstract:**
about what *not* to do to monitor web services, mostly because the tools widely available are based on dated assumptions.
 
Anti-patterns:

- present all data at once, organize them statically
- monitoring graphs are like modern art
- each system, each application is like a snowflake, unique
- Monitoring is for ops only

**Proposer:** Alexis Lê-Quôc
