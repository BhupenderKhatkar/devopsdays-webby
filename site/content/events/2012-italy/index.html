      <p>Registration will open in a few weeks, but we want to give a number of people the opportunity to guarantee their tickets
      before registration open.  That's why we are soliciting  everyone to blog about their devops stories,
      both failure and successes.   The first 15 persons to send us links to their blog post will get priority on registrations.
