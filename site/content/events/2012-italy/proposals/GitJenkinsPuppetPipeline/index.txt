title: "How to chain jenkins, git and puppet in a continuous deployment pipeline
"
---

**Abstract:**


What do you do when you want to automate your jenkins upgrades and your
git server upgrades, and yet still ensure that your puppet scripts are
versioned and the latest HEAD revisions deployed to your puppetmaster?
Where would you begin implementing such a round-trip strategy? Or is it
impossible to keep your infrastructure tools continuously self-updated?
This talk describes how to chain jenkins, git and puppet in a continuous
deployment pipeline. Three tools, five minutes.

**Speaker:**
Sara Haselbauer
