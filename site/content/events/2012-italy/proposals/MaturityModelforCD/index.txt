title: "A maturity model for Continous Delivery"
---

**Abstract:**


Continuous delivery teams are delivering ideas continuously and long before 
others have finished their first iteration. It is business who decides when things
go into production, not IT. How do they do it? I will present a maturity model 
containing practices and tools to accomplish this, and share experiences with 
several of them. Each one adds immediate value, but you shouldn't do them 
all at once. The model can be used to find out where you and your organisation
stand now when it comes to delivering continuously, and which steps you can 
take to improve your abilities
