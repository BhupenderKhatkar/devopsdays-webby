title: "Visualize your git"

**Abstract:**



In this talk I will show how to get three important metrics from your source code history, and how to visualize them.
The slides will be showing in total three one-liners that will produce churn, impact and total lines of code data from
a git repository and then how to visualise these numbers. 
Participants will be inspired to start hacking in the terminal and to get important metrics and numbers that already
exist in their git repository. My presentation-style is calm but energetic and I have held several presentations and
tutorials in english, including Norwegian Developer Conference, Roots Conference and the upcoming Javazone 
conference.
