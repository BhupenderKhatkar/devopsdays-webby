title: "How To Use Puppet Like An Adult"
---

**Abstract:**



« Puppet is an immensely powerful tool for system administration, but 
with great power comes great responsibility, and it’s not always obvious 
how to structure your configurations.  There are many different ways to 
accomplish similar goals, and this malleability has given rise to a 
plethora of different design and architecture principles - some of which 
are good, and many of which are bad.

In this talk, Ben and Dan of Mozilla will explain the guiding principles 
of responsible Puppet design and architecture, walking you through 
real-world examples in order to illustrate solid methodological 
approaches, and illuminate Puppet administrators of all skill levels. 
As an added bonus, they will also show you how Puppet can be integrated 
into automated deployment and continuous integration platforms - an 
increasingly important component of today’s development and operational 
landscape.

This talk will include such topics as:

* The separation of data and logic: How not to commit such Puppet sins 
as hardcoding credentials, paths, and other sensitive variables into 
your modules.
* External data sources: There are a variety of ways to interface Puppet 
with other data sources, including Hiera, puppet-db, extlookup, dilly, 
and more.
* The tiered manifest approach: Leveraging different granularity levels 
for fine-grained control.
* Module-writing best practices: Why it’s important for modules to be as 
generic as possible, and how to deal with differing environments and 
edge cases.
* Explicit sanity preservation: Verifying the validity of the incoming 
values.
* The importance of useful log output: Puppet has mature logging 
facilities built-in.  Use them to get useful output in your dashboard, 
in email digests, and running manually triggered Puppet runs.
* Recommended (and enforced) style guides: Machine-readable manifests 
are good, but human-readable manifests are better.
* A comparison of visualisation tools: Everybody loves charts and 
graphs.  Dashboards, reports aggregators, and automated metrics - oh my! »
