title: "Taming the J2EE Beast with CM"
---

**Abstract:**


Taming the J2EE Beast with CM: How we are using Chef to automate Java application stacks at the UN FAO


Writing a custom DSL (LWRPs in Chef) to handle the millions of options in a J2EE application
Packaging fail: how we use ark to download, unpack, and link java software packages rather than linux distro packages
Using environments to handle attribute inheritance for values such as Xmx, Xms, MaxPermgen
What is lacking: support for partials in templates, better deployment support




From Sysadmin to Infrastructure Developer: Leveling Up


Cover tools and techniques needed to move to the next level. This talk would focus on more on Ruby stuff, less on Chef.


Testing outside-in w/ minitest or cucumber
Using real objects in Ruby and not just a DSL like Chef
Using a code lint tool
integrating w/ Travis-CI
Saner development process using a bundler-clone like berkshelf or librarian-chef
Support that is lacking - full integration test support to run minitest or cucumber tests
