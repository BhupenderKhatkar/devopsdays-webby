title: "The State of Open Source Monitoring: The good, the bad, the fucking terrible, and a glimpse into our future."
---

**Abstract:**

A look back at the last 10 years of open source monitoring and trending
tools. An analysis of recent shifts in tide away from monolithic
monitoring suites towards composable parts. And in conclusion a rant on
the state of visualization in our existing toolset and, in the speaker's
opinion, what needs to change before we get to our "happy place".

**Speaker:**
Jason Dixon
