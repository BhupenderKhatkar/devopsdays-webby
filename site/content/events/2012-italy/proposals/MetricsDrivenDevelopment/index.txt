---

**Abstract:**

The presentation describes  one start-up project and the way we solved problems and moved things forward to handle 70 000 requests per second from the initial 5 000 - with the same hardware. For developers - applications are the essence, but there are a lot more additional pieces that could influence reliability, accessibility and  performance of applications. It will be explained how and why we attracted development guys to the world of monitoring and metrics, the sphere which was considered solely operations playground, how we combined  different metrics: business, application, hardware, 3rd parties and metrics from the cloud to reach our goals, which tools and practices proved to be effective and which not.
