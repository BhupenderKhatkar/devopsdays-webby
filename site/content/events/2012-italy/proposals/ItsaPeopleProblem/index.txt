title: "It's a people problem..."
---

**Abstract:**

The talk will cover issues encountered whilst trying to implement 
DevOps in small and large teams.  I'll also discuss why automation is 
not always the solution and how policies and procedures need to be 
carefully managed so that they assist the DevOps process and do not 
hinder it.

I hope that will be of interest, I promise to try and out-meme anyone 
else who presents... ;)

**Speaker:** 
Matthew Macdonald-Wallace
Director, Green And Secure IT Limited
