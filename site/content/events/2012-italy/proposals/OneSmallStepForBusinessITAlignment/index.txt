title: "DevOps - One small step for business-IT alignment, one giant leap for infrastructure culture"
---

**Abstract:**



System administration or operations has been slow to change over the past 20 years, due to the lack of
a global culture. In this talk Mark Burgess asks why it took the DevOps movement to rediscover some well-known
truths about infrastructure management that were known to isolated pockets, and what the future of
operations has to be -- both in relation to developers and to end users as we grow into the 21st century.




**Speaker:**
Mark Burgess
