title: "From Sysadmin To Infrastructure Developer : Leveling Up"
---

**Abstract:**




We all basically agree with the concepts of Infrastructure as Code but what skills do we need to develop to actually implement it? This presentation will cover tools and techniques needed to move to the next level. 


Testing:
The importance of outside-in-testing
When to use a natural language tool like Cucumber and when something like minitest may be more effective
How to use tools like Rspec for quick feedback
Basic integration w/ Travis-CI to run Lint and Rspec tests


OOP:
I will show the benefits of using real objects in Ruby and not limiting yourself to a DSL provided by your configuration management framework. I will cover basic inheritance and how to use blocks and method_missing? to make your API more expressive.


Then how to manage project dependencies using a bundler-clone like berkshelf or librarian-chef together with Vagrant. I won't cover vagrant much but just just show how coupled with berkshelf it can speed up iterative 


Finally, I want to cover what support is lacking for infrastructure developers - scripting integration tests to run in isolated virtual machines (outside of virtual box).
