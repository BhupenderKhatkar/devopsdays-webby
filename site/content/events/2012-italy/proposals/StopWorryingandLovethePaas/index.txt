title: "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the PaaS"
---

**Abstract:**


 
 PaaS has been striking fear in to the heart of many a developer, with
 its "noops" connotations and flashy, irritating marketing. I would
 like to present open-source PaaS as an enabler of devops and not the
 enemy. Businesses are using PaaS to reduce the feedback cycle time on
 their ideas - so we don't waste our effort building platforms and
 services that aren't useful.


 Developers and operations can use PaaS to deliver value quickly, and
 then develop their PaaS as required. PaaS enables many aspirational
 patterns such as deploying early to a production-like environment,
 Infrastructure as Code and using a single deployment mechanism. I will
 be exploring the PaaS implementations I've been delivering for various
 organisations and the positive and negative ways that a PaaS can
 impact team collaboration and delivery.


 PaaS is not a silver bullet. Teams still need to collaborate to
 deliver services to ensure expectations are met; PaaS does not equal
 infinite scalability, availability and functionality. Compliance and
 security issues do not magically disappear. Consuming closed-source
 PaaS may hinder future capabilities and delivery. However, PaaS also
 isn't a magical foreign land; we can build, maintain and develop
 PaaSes using the tools we all know and love. I will look at the use of
 Chef, Vagrant, Git, Graylog2 and others. You'll be surprised how
 familiar a PaaS actually is.


 It's our responsibility as people tasked to deliver services to use
 the right tool for the job, and I think PaaS will be playing an
 important role in the lives of developers, operations and businesses
 in the future. We should look at how we can get the most out of it.
