title: "Everyone Loves Monitoring"
---

**Abstract:**


About how we changed from an old monitoring monster to a monitoring 
pipeline based on Sensu, Graphite, GDash, RabbitMQ, Pagerduty and 
friends. We have got much better involvement from developers and a more 
engaged management. Developers are now sending data to the monitor 
pipeline directly from the applications, everything is easy graphable, 
we have furnished the office with monitoring screens and management 
loves the graphs and status updates. And we are spending much less time 
on monitoring but have much better control.

A short talk about how it happened and the result of the change
