## Important - Postponing Devopsdays Tel Aviv 

Due to the recent events in Israel, we felt that in order to ensure an awesome DevOps Days Tel Aviv it would be best to delay the event by a couple of months. 

We are still in the process of finalizing the new date, which will likely be in November or early December.  We will be sure to keep you posted as soon as we have a new date.

We hope you understand and are still able to join us.

- Date: **<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_target_date") -%>**
- Location: TBD
