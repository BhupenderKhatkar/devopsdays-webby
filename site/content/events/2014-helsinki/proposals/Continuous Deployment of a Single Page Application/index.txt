title: Continuous Deployment of a Single Page Application - How continuous deployment helps business to prosper?
---
Currently we’re renewing http://www.kauppalehti.fi and https://tietopalvelut.kauppalehti.fi both share similar technology stack: Java6 + Spring + JSP + jQuery. Both are running currently on physical hardware with some virtual servers. Now ongoing projects are not just bringing pretty face to sites, at this time we’re rebuilding most parts from scratch with Java8, Spring Boot, AngularJS and cloud (=Chef). As today we have 124 running instances in the cloud and currently only under 20 is running production services. Kl.fi beta will be publicly available at early November and this is something that I’m would like to talk about. How and what things must change when you choose to run your site from cloud. I’m going to talk about automation = infrastructure as code, service architectural changes, security (this is big issue to us as most data integrated in Tietopalvelut is regulated by law), Monitoring and other operations infrastructure in constantly changing environment, continuous deployment and some words about autoscaling and of course about business perspective getting new features faster (= failing fast), easy a/b testing, new types of business risks and costs. Of course we don’t have first hand experience of all issues but we have already some pretty good battle stories to tell. As well as how to sell cloud to management team.
