title: Introduction to configuration management with Puppet
---
**Abstract:** 

Gone are the days of administering by SSHâ€™ing to machines and running
commands. Consistency and scale dictate a programmatic approach to
administration.

This talk will be explaining how Puppet works and discussing best
practices. While the focus will be using Puppet, the discussion also
includes general configuration management and change management
practices.
