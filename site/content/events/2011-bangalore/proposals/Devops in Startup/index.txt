title: DevOps in Startup
---
**Abstract:** 

As a single person dev/ops team running Muziboo.com and scaling it to
a few million page views on single server, I have learnt some lessons
in monitoring, logging and automation that can help you sleep
peacefully at night. The talk will share some of these learnings and
will be an overview of typical ops tasks in a web startup (like
backup, monitoring, automation etc). I will talk about unix packages
like monit/munin etc and some external services like RPM/Server
Density etc that can help you get your work done efficiently.
