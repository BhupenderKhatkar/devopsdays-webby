title: Push Button Deployment With Jenkins
---
**Abstract:** 

The Continuous Delivery book describes how to setup an automated push-button based system -  that will enable continuous deployment. This talk will demonstrate how to do that - by actually setting up a Continuous Integration server and a build pipeline - using Jenkins and its Build pipeline plugin. Using this setup we can achieve multiple deployments to production in a single day.

This talk will also have a brief demo of Deployinator, deploy tool used by Etsy,  which was made open source very recently.
