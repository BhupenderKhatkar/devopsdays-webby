The conference will be held at [The United States Patent and Trademark
Office](http://www.uspto.gov/)'s Madison Auditorium at 600 Dulany
Street, Alexandria, Virginia, just outside the District (but inside the
Beltway!)

The DevOpsDays DC team urges you to take [Metro](http://www.wmata.com/)
to the event. USPTO is located a few blocks from the [King Street/Old
Town](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=48)
station, which is served by Blue and Yellow line trains, both VRE
commuter lines, and Amtrak. It's also a short ride from [National Airport
(DCA)](http://www.metwashairports.com/reagan/reagan.htm), our recommended
airport for visitors from out of town.

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst
in the nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you
are visiting from out of town. If you must drive, please see [USPTO's
directions page](http://www.uspto.gov/about/contacts/locations/directions.jsp).
