We're in DC and we want a representative blend of attendees for our area.
If you're an employee of the Federal Government, we have a block of tickets
set aside just for you. Please register for the "Government Admission"
ticket type using your .gov or .mil email address. Everyone else (including
federal contractors) can register for the "General Admission" ticket type.

## About Washington, DC

If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or _House of Cards_,
you're missing out. While its importance as the Nation's Capital and center of
government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District, Maryland, and Virginia) is also home
to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community. If you're
coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every segment of
our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some time to check out everything else
the Nation's Capital has to offer, from the many free Smithsonian museums to great
food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere to
our three local airports, and we'll have a hotel deal for you, too.
