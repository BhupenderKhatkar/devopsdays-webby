title: Behavior Driven Infrastructure
---
**Abstract:** 

Agile brought us test-driven development. DevOps brought us configuring infrastructure as code. If we are coding infrastructure, shouldn't we write tests first? This talk shows how to use Ruby and a testing framework called Cucumber to test the configurations you deploy, ensuring that what is being done matches your intent. We will start with a introduction to Cucumber and the Gherkin test dialect, then dive into writing tests for your systems.

This is primarily a demo-driven talk.
