*Panel discussion*

To Package, or not to package that's the question.
To package, but what to package that's another question ?
Thy shalt not package config files ! 
Didn't we already decide the yak would be painted green last decade ? 
But what about all the new stuff like fpm ..   And what about Ruby ? "
