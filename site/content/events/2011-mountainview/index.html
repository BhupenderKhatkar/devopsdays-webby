Last year we had a great time at [Linkedin for the 2010 US Event](/events/2010-us). 

We organized it in tandem with [Velocity 2010](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2010) Conference. Now that the dates for [Velocity 2011](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011) has been announced on June 14-16 2011, we're looking for venues that would be interested in hosting the event.

Also we welcome new volunteers that make this event a blast!

Please [drop us a mail](mailto:info@devopsdays.org) if you're interested in collaborating .

Hope to make the magic happen again.
