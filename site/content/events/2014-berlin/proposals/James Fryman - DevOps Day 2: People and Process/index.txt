**Abstract**

DevOps is often heralded as the solution to all the problems within IT
- planning, slow delivery, large team, etc. All solved via
automation. However, once the dust settles and the new tools are
implemented, the more challenging problem begins. Implementation of a
DevOps type practice requires change and adaptation of the practices
within the framework of the existing culture, and these challenges are
often overlooked or poorly addressed. This talk discusses many of
these challenges as observed in small and large companies alike, how
to plan and execute successfully.
