title: "Moving to The Cloud from a Knowledge Management Perspective"
---

**Abstract**

Like DevOps, Knowledge Management (KM) is a wide topic, ranging from
"knowledge base/store" software to being a highly strategic instrument
influencing the foundations of how a company works. After giving a brief
overview of what KM is, this talk will combine theoretical background
and my observations of what happened to my company by moving to "The
Cloud". I'd like to share how my view on complex systems changed with
(systemic) knowledge management in mind.
