title: "Use Flapjack as bridge between Ops and Dev, and bridge from Nagios towards more freedom"
---

**Abstract**

Flapjack is an alert umbrella for people that intelligently routes and
rolls up alerts, integrates with check execution engines like Sensu &
Nagios, and ships a well documented API for restart-less
configuration.

There are two problems in monitoring:
<ul>
<li>check configuration
<li>notification rules
<li>and a well known third one: check execution
</ul>

I would considder the configuring checks part more or less solved in
times of automated setups via Puppet or Chef.

Still there is the problem with notifications. Nobody wants to get
flooded with alerts and often the alerts that reach people are just
poorly chosen. Sometimes even the wrong people are chosen. Ops are
getting alerts that are only useful for devs and vice versa.  I've
observed that Devs and Ops are suffering from a lag of influence on
those notification rules configuration.

This talk will give you an option to tackle this problem with the help
of flapjack and move away from Nagios to whatever you like more at the
same time.
