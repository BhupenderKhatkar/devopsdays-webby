title: "Getting Started with ChatOps"
---

**Abstract**

ChatOps is a relatively new concept coined by GitHub, in where daily
operations are orchestrated in plain sight in the same chat room used
to communicate with team members. The implementation of ChatOps is as
much a cultural change as it is a technological one. This concept
often brings up many concerns - are all my users trusted to use
ChatOps? Should they be? How can I train them? Etc. This talk is a
practical discussion expanding on the ChatOps concept - how do you get
started, how should you prepare, etc.

**Speaker**

James Fryman, GitHub
