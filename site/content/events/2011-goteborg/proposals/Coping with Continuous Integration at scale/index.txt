title: Coping with Continuous Integration at scale.
---
**Abstract:** 

Tom and Tom are interested in Continuous Integration (CI)
when it gets big. In this session, we draw upon our experiences of
helping large clients implement CI for complex systems and share
observations of the good, bad and ugly things we've seen. We'll
present a series of real-world anti-patterns and propose some remedies
and principles to avoid them.

CI is a core practice in building high-quality software. Since its
inception, patterns of best practice have emerged, books have been
written and a plethora of tools have been launched and improved. CI
has not only been growing in maturity, but also in scope: taking
responsibility beyond the build and test cycle. This growth into a key
Continuous Delivery practice sees it addressing some of the 'last
mile' problems along the path to production. Simultaneously, the
software being integrated has become increasingly complex and
interdependent. We have moved from a state where CI was used for
simple tasks on homogenous software programs to a world where CI
performs difficult tasks on complex, fragmented, heterogenous systems.

We will also look at how CI problems change from being predominantly
technical to organisational as systems become bigger and more complex.
We will demonstrate how these problems are frequently intertwined,
unclear, and hard to resolve. Topics will include things like: how to
divide responsibility for build pipelines; CI skills as a specialism;
CI frameworks; ways to tackle build-time dependency management;
considerations in managing a heterogeneous build farm.

We're sure we don't have all the answers but are keen to share the
lessons that we learnt the hard way.
