title: We Can't Hug Our Way to Success - The Need for a DevOps Rollout Strategy
---
**Abstract:** 

This short talk presents the thesis that every movement such as DevOps must produce processes and tools that can lead to a large scale adoption.  Failure to do so relegates the movement to a fad.  This talk is a rallying cry for the community to get to the defined process and tools stage in the development of the movement faster.

**Proposer:** Maciej Zawadzki, J.D.Co-Founder and CEO Urbancode, Inc.
