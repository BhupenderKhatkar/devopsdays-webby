title: A case study in operations and development integration at Spotify
---
**Abstract:**


We have lots of material to draw from talking about how we work with integration between operations and software development.

This talk will be around a narrative about how we have grown
as a company and how our challenges has changed as the number of users
has grown and the technical complexity of the service has increased.

We have learned lots of stuff about how we communicate efficiently and
handle short term issues that arise in the production environment as
well as how we do medium to long term planning in cooperation between
the operations team and development teams.

Moving forward with new development at a fast pace while at the same
time maintaining a high quality of service is a balancing act that
requires communication and thinking hard about how the organization is
set up.

We think that it would be possible to squeeze in one or two real world
case studies about more or less catastrophic failures that we've had
to deal with and how those experiences has shaped our processes.

High level outline:

- description of the spotify service, our organization and a very
brief technical description of the backend systems
- the early days: devs did everything
- the conflict of interest between reliability and new features
- how the ops team got overloaded with short term panicky stuff and
how we're using kanban weekly retrospective and planning meetings to
try to work around that
- system owner responsibilities at operations, subsystem planning meetings
- weekly scalability meetings to plan resource allocation and
propagate information about incidents
- how to keep devs happy: the #operations irc channel, quick response
times via email
- keeping track of incidents and that gets aggregated to service
availability numbers
- case study: cascading failures, analyzing subsystem dependencies one
of the most important things we do. Strategies to be able to do
partial deployments, and rolling back changes.
