title: Dev+Ops+Org  - How we are including (almost) everyone
---
**Abstract:** 

The presentation will give an insight into how the whole of Nokia Entertainment has embraced DevOps:

#### The Journey: Start-up mentality to Corporate and back again

> A short history on how Nokia Entertainment came to be and the shift we have made from start-up to Corporate to best of both.

#### Elephant hunting: Realizing there is a problem to solve

> We’ll give some insight into what Nokia Entertainment did to recognize the issues and how we are overcoming them
               
#### Integration: Why Dev+Ops+Tools may not be enough

> As a business grows, DevOps and effective tooling can only take it so far.  We recognized we needed to go further

#### Collaboration: Building a trust relationship with those outside of the traditional DevOps group

> Effective adoption of DevOps is bigger than developers and operations. We’ll provide some examples on how we used collaboration to become effective

#### Culture: Changing the default pattern to allow DevOps to thrive

> We’ll provide some background on how we gained wide spread acceptance for DevOps

#### The future: It’s a long and winding road with growing pains - but it’s worth it!

> We still have a way to go, and we’ll talk about the challenges, but we’re seeing huge benefits and are determined to forge ahead.
