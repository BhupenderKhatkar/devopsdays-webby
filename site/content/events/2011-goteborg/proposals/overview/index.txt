There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : there are 45 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
	<li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
	<li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
</ol>
