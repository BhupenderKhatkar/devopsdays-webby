title: DevOps Counselling - 10 ways to help your Dev and Ops people resolve their differences and learn to love each other again.
---
**Abstract:** "

 So you've drunk the DevOps kool-aid & formed a delivery team
that includes sysadmins, developers, QAs and everyone else. Everything
should be awesome. But somehow, it isn't. The same old issues keep
cropping up: unreliability, inertia, blame-storming, bugs, downtime. I
look into why building a cross-functional team involves more than just
re-drawing an org chart: new practices, tools, and cultural norms need
to be built-up.

Drawing on experiences from a variety of organizations that have
attempted to build delivery teams, I propose my top ten tips for
helping development and operations people overcome their differences
and start truly collaborating on the practices necessary to create and
run great software.
