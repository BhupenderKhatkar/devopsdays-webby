title: Scaling lessons learned in 15 years of guardian.co.uk
---
**Abstract:** 

(how to spot when an app is struggling in production (and stop it))
Simple techniques that make it easier to manage a large number of
applications in production

At the Guardian we have a large number of applications in production
at any one time, which can cause problems if they start hogging
resources or behaving badly.  This talk will share some of the lessons
we learned and go over some horror stories when apps went badly wrong.

**Proposer:** Michael Brunton-Spall - Lisa van-Gelder
