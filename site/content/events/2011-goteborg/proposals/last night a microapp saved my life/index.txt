title: Last night a microapp saved my life
---
**Abstract:** 

Any given page on the guardian.co.uk can be composed of
the output of several different applications being weaved together by
the Content Management System (CMS) before being sent to the user as a
single HTML document.  This platform architecture was put in place
after the realisation that our CMS was doing more and more non-content
data modelling resulting in application bloat.  In this talk, we will
give examples of the type of work we were trying to get our CMS to do
when we realised it shouldnâ€™t; examples of applications we have built
using the microapp framework; how microapps enable rapid deployment,
in particular our use of cloud hosting for microapps and how caching
protects us from misbehaving microapps that we may not have even
built.
