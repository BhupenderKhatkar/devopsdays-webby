title: From Chaos to Automation

**Abstract:** 

A fairy tale of sweat, hurry and pain 

Listen to a good old story: the tale of an Internet company, that has grown frantically for too many years.
Hordes of hosts crafted in different generations, stratified processes sculpted in scripts and arcane procedures.
Knowledge transferred by word of mouth, glimpses of memories and documentation that becomes obsolete in the same moment you write it.
Hundreds of different server roles, deploy procedures, setups and, always, tickets tickets tickets everywhere...
All this managed by a small bunch of tired sysadmins overwhelmed by the contingency, fighting with bug-friendly developers exasperated by the lack of a real testing environment.

Imagine to have the occasion, and luck, to be asked to work on the optimization of the infrastructure and its processes,
without caring too much of tickets, meetings and day by day activities.

From where to begin? What are the priorities, what's the approach, which steps you take, what tools you use?
Here's a story of an ongoing process on infrastructure automation and procedures optimizations, where we will talk about configuration management, applications deployments, monitoring, testing, documentation and... people.

Be warned: there's not (yet) an happy end, but the process is fun.
