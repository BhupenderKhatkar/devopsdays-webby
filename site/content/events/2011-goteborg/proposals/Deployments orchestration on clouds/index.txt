title: Deployments Orchestration on Clouds
---
**Abstract:** 

One of the main contributing factors in maximising confidence in your production releases is an ability to get a timely feedback from automated tests run on auto deployed testing and load environments.

We share techniques and lessons learned in building and orchestrating on-the-fly test and production environments on public and private clouds with SlipStream <http://slipstream.sixsq.com> . This facilitates automated, on-demand, creation of multi-machine runtime environments acting as a software engineering PaaS solution on clouds.

Such an approach allows all stakeholders in the project (e.g.  developers, testers, QA, system administrators, managers, end-users) to deploy on-demand their own instance of the system being produced, continuously.

We also show how we eat our own dog food while developing, integrating and releasing the StratusLab IaaS cloud solution <http://www.stratuslab.eu> .

This will be a hands-on presentation alternating between slides and short live demos. We will demonstrate multi-tier deployments of various complexity, such that the audience gains concrete knowledge on how we do this in our daily work.

Through this session, we will show how we can integrate such approach in a CI strategy e.g. tools like Hudson/Jenkins, as well as how we can leverage existing installation recipes such as in Chef.
