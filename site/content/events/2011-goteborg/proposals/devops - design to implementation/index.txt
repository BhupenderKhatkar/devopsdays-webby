title: DevOps -  Design to Implementation
---
**Abstract:**

Since late last year we have been trying to get an official project off the ground which essentially delivers a DevOps team and product. Now that we have
an official team we have started work and have been enjoying a lot of success in what we do. I will present material on the core areas I think explain how
you go from the “concept” or “spirit” of DevOps into how it is actually implemented in reality beyond buzzwords and concepts:

* Prerequisites to an implementation of DevOps (policitical/management acceptance, having champions of your cause in management).
* Building an ops team around a development mindset.
* Getting away from scripting habits and into building richer applications in real programming languages that are maintainable and extendable.
* Interacting with infrastructure programmatically, and the challenges this represents for code testability.
* Introducing Continuous Integration into operations and infrastructure work.
* Building test suites for infrastructure (network, storage, computing).
* Interacting with hardware teams using test suites to reduce turnaround times.
* Building systems around well-defined interfaces and APIs (providing flexibility and understandability not only for others interacting with your
  systems, but also allowing you to modularize and swap in/out components as necessary).
* Between now and October I expect to expand on these topics some more so there may be even more useful material.
