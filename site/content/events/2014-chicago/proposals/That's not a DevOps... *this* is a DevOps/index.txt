Many people come to DevOps Days events to find out what DevOps actually is. As notorious for being poorly defined as it is revered for its potential benefits, neophytes look to leaders in the space for guidance. In return they are often bombarded with abstract theories, intellectual concepts and a veritable torrent of information that often leaves them feeling further from the truth than when they started out.
