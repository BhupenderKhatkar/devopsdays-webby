title: 'Taking back the Tools - Using "DevOps Tools" to Train a Support Team'
---

**Abstract**

Too often DevOps tools are seen as developer-only toolbox, used to test code, prepare deployments and test configuration management setups.

Working in Managed Hosting, we get to see a lot of different setups. The questions we are asked span the range of how to add a new user to helping customers understand why their replication is broken or their website is "slow". It is a fast paced environment where you are always challenged to learn more.

So with that, I want to share a different approach to using tools such as Vagrant and Ansible for system administrator / operations training.

This session will be focused around sharing ideas, lessons learned, and techniques for building out training for your support teams.
