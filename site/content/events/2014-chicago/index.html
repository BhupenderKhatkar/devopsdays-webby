We're planning Devopsdays Chicago!

It will take place on Tuesday, October 7th and Wednesday, October 8th, 2014 in Chicago, IL (venue information coming soon).

The call for proposals [is now open](/events/2014-chicago/propose/) and will close on Friday, August 15th. The call for proposals will be for both standard conference talks and [Ignite Talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event\)). Around half the time at Devopsdays Chicago will be [Open Space Format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format/), so come prepared even if you don't submit a proposal!

We hope to see you in Chicago in October!
