title: "From manual to CD in 5 minutes (How to modernize a project without affecting the business)"
---

**Abstract:**

9 months ago we’ve started to modernize HP Software SaaS portal.
We’ve started from a project without anything related to build / automation or anything even close to continuous delivery.
Ended with fully automated CD process and embracement of DevOps cultures.
On the other hand this is a business with ~800 paying customers (some of them tier1 companies).
In this ignite talk I will describe the rules and concepts we’ve followed to achieve this goal.

**Speaker:**
