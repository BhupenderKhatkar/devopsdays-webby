Searching 28 files for "Today everyone is talking about clouds, and a few are building them, but far fewer are operating successful clouds.  In this session we'll examine a variety of paradigm shifts IT makes when moving from a traditional virtualization and management mindset to operating a successful cloud.  For most organizations, without careful planning the hype of a given cloud solution can quickly overcome its capabilities and pre-existing best practices can combine to create the worst possible cloud scenario -- a cloud which isn't economical to operate, and which is more cumbersome to manage than a traditional virtualization farm.

Key topics covered include:

- Successful transition of operational and management paradigm
- How the VM density of clouds change Ops
- What it means to monitor the network in a cloud environment, at hyper-dense virtualization levels
- Preventing storage costs from outpacing the capacity of the cloud

The presentation is vendor, hypervisor and cloud management model neutral, though some technology and implementation decisions will impact the possible cloud management solutions."
