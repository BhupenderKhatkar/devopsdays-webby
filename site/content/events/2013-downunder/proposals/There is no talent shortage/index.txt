title: "There is no talent shortage"
---

**Abstract:**

Many organizations believe they are in a struggle to recruit and retain technical talent.
While most recognize the time new hires require to become familiar and productive,
very few organizations have a training component built into their onboarding,
and even less emphasize ongoing learning as part of the process.

The evidence suggests learning cultures have significant advantages, not only
in productivity and quality, but also in attracting and retaining the best people,
yet many seem reluctant to invest. Or maybe they just don't know how?

This talk will present a combination of research from different disciplines
on learning and culture together with personal anecdotes from involvement and
observations as different roles, from developer, to manager, to founder,
to tutor, to consultant about the impact of learning on people and organizations.

Learning Outcomes:

- What does it mean to be a learning organization?
- What does it take?
- What are the barriers?
- What are the advantages of continuous learning? Short Term? Long Term?
- What might be the disadvantages?
- How learning environment are the natural habitat of good people, and how that attracts and retains talent.
