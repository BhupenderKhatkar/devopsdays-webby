## DevOpsDays Vancouver 2014

<div><p style="font-size:large;">Friday November 14 to Saturday November 15, 2014</p></div>

DevOpsDays is returning to Vancouver in 2014.

This conference, which is now happening frequently around the globe, is THE conference for bridging the gap between developers and operations.

<a href="http://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a> is a grassroots event for folks in the field connecting, sharing war stories, advice, ideas, and tools relating to DevOps.

It is organized by people who care about DevOps.

## Propose a Talk

We are currently shouting out for speakers. If you are doing something new and interesting in the DevOps space we want to hear from you! If you have something great to talk about, then we're happy to help you polish and practice your presentation.

Also, if you know someone who would be a great speaker or somebody you would like to see, let us know! This is a community driven event, so we want your input.

Patrick Debois, who started DevOps Days and is also helping co-ordinate events around the world, recently said in an interview that "the content of the show needs to continuously evolve and be new. We donâ€™t want content that is already available online. We want new content and controversial ideas for our audience." Let's make that happen!
