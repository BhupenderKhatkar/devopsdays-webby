**Abstract:**

Abstract: In this talk, I will tell some true war stories and anecdotes from bringing DevOps into companies that have never heard of it or probably would never touch it. I will explain the tricks that can be used to try to bring them there. I will also explain the motivation behind their resistance and how to come around it.

Objectives: entertain the audience, deliver concrete ideas on how to push DevOps in the own companies
