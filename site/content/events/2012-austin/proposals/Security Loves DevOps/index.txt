title: Security Loves Devops
---
**Abstract:** 

A lot of Dev and Ops people look at their security teams with disdain.
"Those guys are just blockers... All they do is throw obstacles in my
way and say no. They'll never be DevOps or even Agile." In return many
security people see the emergence of DevOps as creating a wilder, less
managed environment in which they would face more risk and greater
security challenges.

So who is right? Can DevOps and security co-exist? Can they learn from
one another?  We will take a deeper look into:

* What DevOps means for a Security professional
* How DevOps can be sold to Security
* How Security practice can enhance DevOps
* How DevOps can influence Risk decisions and help manage risk appetite

Letâ€™s see if DevOps and Security can have a long and prosperous
relationship.
