There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 35 minute slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>A Lightning or <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format">Ignite</a> talk</em></strong> These are 5 minutes slots with minimal slides and no question time.  Also presented to all attendees in one room. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
</ol>

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. There is a demo openspace slot where you have 5 minutes to show products.


<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong>
Please fill in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ySQYjflcdogiL_dwohQHAmxTF48fofiol4XT3V1UF-U/viewform">proposal form. </a>
Don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %>">email </a> the organisers if you have any questions about presenting.

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 2 paragraphs is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
