## Call for proposals open

We are currently accepting talk proposals and you can expect a fleshed out program in the beginning of March.

Meanwhile, why not [submit a proposal](/<%= @eventhome -%>/propose), or help us create a great program by [giving feedback on current proposals](/<%= @eventhome -%>/proposals)!
