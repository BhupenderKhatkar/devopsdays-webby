title: "Scaling a Start-up DevOps team to 10x while scaling the system 50x"

**Abstract:**

Sumo Logic has built a strong DevOps culture. All our back-end
developers are on the on-call rotation, taking responsibility for
running the system 24/7 and rolling out new code multiple times a
week. This talk is about how we successfully grew that culture. The
lessons learned, things that worked, things that didnâ€™t. How our
culture has evolved.

**Speaker:**
