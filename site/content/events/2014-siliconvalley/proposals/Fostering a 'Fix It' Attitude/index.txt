**Abstract:**

When working in a development environment with engineering bandwidth
constraints, it's easy to allow the 'fix it later' mentality to guide
your engineering teams. The results of the technical debt accumulating
over time can then affect the happiness of your team and ultimately
your customers.

At PagerDuty, we empower our engineers to take ownership of the
problems that cause them the most pain, and encourage them to fix
those problems. By owning and fixing these problems it improves the
quality of our product and the happiness of our engineers and
customers alike.

Using examples from PagerDuty, we'll discuss ways you can foster this
mentality with your engineers, while getting everyone in your
organization to appreciate the importance of limiting technical debt.
