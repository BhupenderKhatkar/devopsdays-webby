**Abstract:**

The problem for a husband who can do or fix anything is that the wife
creates a really big honey-do list. This is exacerbated when living on
a homestead where there’s always more work to do. The work arrives at
a faster rate than it’s possible to complete. Happy wife happy life
they say. But it can take a toll on hero husband when he’s taking down
the barn and the wife has already moved onto the next project of
building a 16 x 24 ft. greenhouse.

This is a true story about a wife who learned some lessons about
maximizing the completion of honey-do list requests.

1. Limit the number of projects in the hubs queue
2. Look at flow efficiency an alternative to economies of scale.

Consider the job of splitting firewood. Manually splitting 4 cords of
wood with an ax is backbreaking, dangerous work. Automating the job by
renting a power log splitter appears to increase efficiency with
economies of scale, but masks problems resulting in big batch size
firewood delivery. Building a power log splitter (with a truck bed
shoot:) increased flow efficiency with small batch size benefits.

Economies of scaled (with respect to resource efficiency) and flow
efficiency had competing elements. We’ll explore what those were and
how they saved money, the hubs back, and the marital blissJ
