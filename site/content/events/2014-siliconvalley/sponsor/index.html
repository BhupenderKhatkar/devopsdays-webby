There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. We'll have sponsors for an evening social and a speakers dinner with special privileges for the sponsors of these events. The details will depend on the venue, which hasn't been settled. If you are interested in special sponsorships or have a creative idea about how you can support the event, <a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>?subject=Sponsor devopsdays <%= @eventid %>">send us an email</a>.

<br/>
DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends on your sponsorships to happen. However, because of the nature of the event, we do not have vendor booths or book product pitches.
Attendees, including sponsors, will have the opportunity to host a 5 minute product demo as part of an open space session during the program.
<br/>
Gold sponsors do get a table they can hang out at and put materials on for interested people to come visit during breaks, and of course all attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the openspaces, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees. The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
